  "explanation": "Dalaran (or the City of Dalaran, pronounced DAHL-uh-RAWN) is the capital of the magocratic nation of the same name. The city's inner fortress has served as the focal point for magi and the study of the arcane throughout human history. Originally located by the Lordamere Lake in the Eastern Kingdoms, the city was magically moved to Northrend by the power of its magic. They fought both against the Dragon Aspect Malygos's crusade to eradicate the use of magic on Azeroth, and the undead forces of the Lich King. Dalaran would later be set in motion and fly high above the seas, as seen during the Purge. During the third invasion of the Burning Legion, Dalaran was moved to Karazhan, and then teleported to the Broken Isles in order to serve as a focal point in the fight against the Burning Legion's invasion.",
